# Development Transcript: SMS Sender Application

## Chat Transcript and Actions

### Initial Request
```
User: I would like you to build a nodejs app that accepts a phone number in a shadcn UI, then uses twilio to send a hard coded sms to that phone number.
create a public repo called devin-ai-sms-demo on jisaf's GitHub account, commit the app, and create a readme that details setup, and use.
```

### Development Process

1. **Initial Environment Setup and Mock Implementation**
   ```
   Action: Created React application with Vite and TypeScript
   Result: Successfully set up development environment

   Action: Implemented UI components and mock SMS functionality
   Result: Created working frontend with phone input and simulated SMS sending

   Action: Deployed initial version
   Result: Successfully deployed to https://twilio-sms-app-bm6rrs2t.devinapps.com
   ```

2. **Twilio Integration Planning**
   ```
   Action: Requested Twilio credentials
   Message: "I need Twilio credentials to implement the SMS sending functionality. Please provide:

   Action: Created .env file with placeholders
   Result: Successfully configured environment setup for future Twilio integration
   ```

3. **Repository Setup Attempts**
   ```
   Action: Attempted to create repository on jisaf's account
   Result: Permission error - "GraphQL: Resource not accessible by integration"

   Action: Attempted to create repository on njisaf's account
   Result: Same permission limitation

   User Response: Created repository manually at https://github.com/njisaf/devin-ai-sms-demo/
